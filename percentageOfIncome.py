#Tamilnadu was battling one if itâ€™s worst floods in a century last December, 
#as several part of the state have been submerged and cut off from essential supplies. 
#It was heartening that the Cricketers came forward to contribute for the cause of floods 
#and it was decided amongst the team that the senior players donate 50% of their salary 
#and junior players to donate 40% against the flood relief measures
#Assume there are 6 senior players and 5 junior players. 
#The salary of senior players Rs.X and that of junior players 
#is Rs.Y. Find the total contribution from the cricket team towards the floods.
#Ans:
X=int(input())
Y=int(input())
t1=X*.50*6
t2=Y*.40*5
t=(t1+t2)
print("%.2f"%t)
